# JsShooterGame

I created this game during my winter break while attending a coding boot camp. At the time i had about two months experice in JS, HTML and CSS. This was definetly fun to do and also a great learning experience that solidified my understanding of Javascript. I'll be polishing this game and adding more features soon. 

Thanks for checking it out!
