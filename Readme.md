Hi, I created this game during my winter break while attending a coding boot camp. I had about two months experice in JS, HTML and CSS at this point. I went back and added a few features about a month later. This was definetly fun to do and also a great learning expeirce that solidified my understanding of Javascript. I'll be polishing this game and adding more features soon. 

Thanks for checking it out!
